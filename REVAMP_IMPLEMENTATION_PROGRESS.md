# REVAMP Project Implementation Progress Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive implementation progress for transforming the podcast generation app into an automated weekly curation service called "REVAMP". The implementation focuses on data architecture, state management, UI components, and business logic while excluding changes to AI and functions modules.

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema Implementation
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

- **Updated Prisma Schema** to include all required models:

  - Added `CuratedPodcast` model (25 editor's choice shows)
  - Added `CuratedBundle` model (3 pre-curated bundles)
  - Added `CuratedBundlePodcast` junction table
  - Added `Notification` model for in-app notifications
  - Enhanced `Subscription` model for Link.com integration
  - Added unique constraint ensuring one user curation profile per user

  - Single collection per user enforcement
  - Hybrid content selection (custom vs bundles)
  - Image URL support for all content types
  - Generation tracking fields
  - Notification system architecture
  - South African payment integration ready
