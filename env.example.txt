# Admin Panels V2 feature flags
# Purpose: Toggle visibility of the new SSR admin panels links in the legacy Admin Dashboard page.
# Notes:
# - These flags do NOT grant access. Admin routes remain protected by server checks.
# - Client-safe flags (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) take precedence if both are set.
# - Accepted truthy: 1,true,t,yes,y,on (case-insensitive)
#   Accepted falsy: 0,false,f,no,n,off

# Recommended local development defaults (enable all SSR admin panels links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PANELS_V2_BUNDLES=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PANELS_V2_PODCASTS=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PANELS_V2_EPISODES=1

# Optional: server-only variants (use if you do not want to expose to client)
# ADMIN_PANELS_V2_BUNDLES=1
# ADMIN_PANELS_V2_PODCASTS=1
# ADMIN_PANELS_V2_EPISODES=1
