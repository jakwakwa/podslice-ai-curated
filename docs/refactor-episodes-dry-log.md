# Episodes DRY Refactor Log

- Date: 2025-09-27
- Context: Align `/episodes/[id]/page.tsx` with `/my-episodes/[id]/page.tsx` patterns and extract reusable components.

## Actions

1. Created shared UI components under `components/features/episodes/`:
   - `EpisodeShell.tsx` — unified outer layout wrapper used by both pages.
   - `EpisodeHeader.tsx` — header with title, createdAt, duration, optional badges/link.
   - `KeyTakeaways.tsx` — renders cleaned key takeaways matching my-episodes styling.
   - `PlayAndShare.client.tsx` — shared client component enforcing signed-URL-only playback for curated and user episodes.

2. Added `app/(protected)/episodes/[id]/page.dry.tsx`:
   - Keeps existing auth + access logic, signed URL resolution.
   - Uses new shared components and follows my-episodes pattern to only show key takeaways (no raw markdown block).

3. Left legacy `page.tsx` intact for cross-reference per request.

## Next Steps

- Swap `page.tsx` to the refactored version after verification.
- Optionally update `/my-episodes/[id]/page.tsx` to consume the shared components for full DRY compliance.
- Add unit tests for `extractKeyTakeaways` rendering and signed URL wiring.

## Notes

- No middleware or sensitive logging changed.
- Explicit types preserved; no `any` introduced.
- Lint updated for unused imports.
