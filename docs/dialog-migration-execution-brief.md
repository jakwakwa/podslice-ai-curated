Executive Summary

Project Phase: Critical Infrastructure Component Migration
Priority: CRITICAL - Must be completed before any page migrations
Status: Ready to Execute (Infrastructure Complete)

Context

Following the successful completion of our theming infrastructure unification (Tailwind + CSS variables + build pipeline), we must now migrate all dialog/modal components from CSS modules to our unified Tailwind system. This is the most critical next step because dialog components are used across multiple pages and serve as foundational UI elements.

Why This Migration is Critical

Cross-Page Dependencies: Dialogs are used in dashboard, bundles, account, and admin pages
Form Infrastructure: Contains complex form layouts that need consistent styling
Prevents Duplicate Work: Completing this first prevents having to fix the same components multiple times
Foundation for Page Migrations: Once dialogs work, individual page migrations become straightforward

üéØ Migration Objectives

Primary Goals

Eliminate CSS Module Dependencies: Remove all *.module.css imports from dialog components
Implement Tailwind Classes: Replace custom CSS with our unified design tokens
Maintain Visual Consistency: Ensure identical appearance and behavior
Improve Type Safety: Leverage TypeScript with our component variants

Success Metrics

‚úÖ Zero CSS module imports in dialog components
‚úÖ All dialogs using Tailwind utilities and our design tokens
‚úÖ Build successful (pnpm build:fast passes)
‚úÖ All form elements styled consistently

üìã Components to Migrate

1. Core Dialog Infrastructure

Files: components/ui/dialog.tsx, components/ui/dialog.module.css

Current State:

Uses CSS modules for modal positioning and backdrop
Custom animations and transitions
Z-index management

Target State:

Tailwind utilities for layout (fixed inset-0 z-50)
CSS variables for colors (bg-background, text-foreground)
Maintain existing animations using Tailwind classes

2. EditUserFeedModal Component

Files:

components/features/edit-user-feed-modal.tsx
components/features/edit-user-feed-modal.module.css

Current State:

Complex form layout with CSS module classes
Custom button groups and input styling
Modal container positioning

Target State:

Tailwind grid/flexbox for layout
Our Button component variants
Input components with design tokens

3. UserFeedSelector Component

Files:

components/features/user-feed-selector.tsx
components/features/user-feed-selector.module.css

Current State:

List layouts with custom CSS
Selection states and hover effects
Filter and search components

Target State:

Tailwind layout utilities
Hover states using Tailwind (hover:bg-accent)
Search inputs using our Input component

4. Form Components (if needed)

Files: Input, Select, Textarea components with dialog-specific styling

Assessment: Determine if these need updates for dialog context

üîß Technical Implementation Plan

Infrastructure Analysis

Audit Current CSS Modules: Document all classes being used
Map to Tailwind Utilities: Create conversion table
Identify Custom Styles: Note any styles that need special handling

Core Dialog Migration

Update Dialog Base Component:
// Before
<div className={styles.overlay}>
  <div className={styles.content}>

// After
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm">
  <div className="fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-card border border-border rounded-lg shadow-lg">
Remove CSS Module Import: Delete import styles from "./dialog.module.css"
Update Animations: Convert to Tailwind animation classes
Test Dialog Functionality: Ensure open/close behavior works

EditUserFeedModal Migration

Layout Conversion:
// Before
<div className={styles.formContainer}>
  <div className={styles.formGroup}>

// After
<div className="space-y-6 p-6">
  <div className="space-y-4">
Form Elements:
Replace input styling with our Input component
Update button groups with Button variants
Apply consistent spacing with Tailwind
Typography: Use our Typography components (H2, Body, etc.)

UserFeedSelector Migration

List Layouts: Convert to Tailwind flexbox/grid
Selection States: Use state-based Tailwind classes
Interactive Elements: Apply hover/focus states

Testing & Validation

Build Test: Run pnpm build:fast && pnpm lint - must pass build. linting errors need to be fixed. warnings can be ingnored but isnt recommended

üé® Design Token Application

Color Mapping

// CSS Module Classes ‚Üí Tailwind Utilities
styles.overlay       ‚Üí "bg-background/80"
styles.modalContent  ‚Üí "bg-card text-card-foreground"
styles.border        ‚Üí "border-border"
styles.button        ‚Üí Button component variants

Layout Patterns

// Modal Container
"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center"

// Modal Content
"bg-card border border-border rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-md w-full mx-4"

// Form Layout
"space-y-6 p-6"

// Button Groups
"flex gap-2 justify-end"

Typography Application

// Dialog Headers
<H2>Modal Title</H2>

// Dialog Content
<Body>Modal description text</Body>

// Form Labels
<Label htmlFor="input">Field Label</Label>

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

High Risk Areas

Complex Form Layouts:
Risk: Breaking existing form functionality
Mitigation: Test incrementally, maintain exact spacing
Z-Index Conflicts:
Risk: Modal appearing behind other elements
Mitigation: Use Tailwind's z-index scale consistently
Animation Timing:
Risk: Jarring transition changes
Mitigation: Match existing timing with Tailwind animations

Low Risk Areas

Color Application: Design tokens are already proven
Typography: Typography system is well-established
Build System: Infrastructure is stable

Automated Testing

Build Validation: pnpm build must pass without warnings
Type Checking: Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
Linting: Run pnpm lint for code quality

Manual Testing Checklist

All dialogs open and close properly
Form submissions work correctly
Keyboard navigation functions
Focus management is maintained
Responsive design works on mobile
All button interactions work
Selection states are visual clear
Error states display properly

Visual Regression Testing

Screenshot comparison before/after
Check spacing and alignment
Verify color consistency
Confirm typography hierarchy
