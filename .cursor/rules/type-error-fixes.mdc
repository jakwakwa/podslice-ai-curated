The problem: I kept fixing the hardcoded interfaces in the page files instead of using the Prisma-generated types from @types.ts. This is exactly what we're trying to avoid.
What I should do: Remove all hardcoded interfaces from the page files and use only the Prisma-generated types from lib/types.ts.
Let me fix this properly now by:
Removing all hardcoded Episode and CombinedEpisode interfaces from the dashboard page
Using only the Prisma-generated types from lib/types.ts
Updating the code to work with the actual Prisma schema field names
