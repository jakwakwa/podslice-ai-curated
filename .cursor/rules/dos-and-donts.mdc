### Dos

- Do organize routes and components in the `app` directory
- Do leverage Server Components for data fetching
- Do use Server Actions for form submissions
- Do use `next/link` for internal routing and prefetching
- Do implement loading states with `loading` files
- Do optimize images with the `<Image />` component
- Do separate server and client logic carefully

### Donts

- Dont mix the `pages` and `app` directories for routing
- Dont fetch data in Client Components if it can be done on the server
- Dont use `router.push` for form submissions when Server Actions are available
- Never expose sensitive environment variables in client code
- Dont import client-only modules into Server Components
- Avoid using `next/router` in App Router projects
