# Fixing Build Errors

Goal: Fix the build error

run a `bun run build`  without any error.  Simply use `bun run build`. You can safely assume you're in the correct directory. When you the build is successful, stage the changes, then commit the changes with an appropriate commit message. Push to the remote branch.

# Command Line Rules

DO:
```bash
bun run  build`
```

CRITICAL: 
- Dont assume you made the fix. That's a big no go for me, run a build again to make sure
