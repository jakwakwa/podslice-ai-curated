# When building new code That requires ui jsx based components

- use exisiting added shadcn/ui components
- use css modules. remove tailwindcss classes and replace with css in stylesheet
  - incrementally if you worked on a file that has tailwind
- use already created Button, Input, Sooner (Toasts), etc
- use existing theme colors - dont change theme colors that's me, the your boss's, job
