### Notes

- Project uses Vitest. Run tests with `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:watch`).
- Lint with `pnpm lint`; build with `pnpm build`.
- Follow workspace rules: thin pages, server reads, client interactivity, safe GCS init, and Prisma types from `lib/types.ts`.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Finalize Server/Client panel structure for Bundles, Podcasts, Episodes
  - [x] 1.1 Audit existing `page.tsx` and panels to confirm thin pages and server-only reads; preserve current caching (`dynamic`/ISR)
  - [x] 1.2 Ensure Bundles/Podcasts/Episodes server panels only fetch on the server (either via `fetch` to existing APIs or Prisma)
  - [x] 1.3 Add co-located `loading.tsx` fallbacks for `bundles/`, `podcasts/`, and `episodes/` routes
  - [x] 1.4 Add co-located `error.tsx` boundaries for `bundles/`, `podcasts/`, and `episodes/` routes with minimal UX
  - [x] 1.5 Validate imports use `import type` for types and follow schema casing rules

- [x] 2.0 Implement per-panel feature flags and wiring for rollback (`ADMIN_PANELS_V2_*`)
  - [x] 2.1 Create `lib/flags.ts` with helpers (e.g., `isEnabled("ADMIN_PANELS_V2_BUNDLES")`); read from `process.env`
  - [x] 2.2 Update `app/(protected)/admin/page.tsx` to conditionally surface links/entry points to new sub-pages based on flags
  - [x] 2.3 Document `.env` usage for flags and add sensible defaults for local dev
  - [x] 2.4 Add minimal unit tests for `lib/flags.ts`

- [x] 3.0 Migrate simple admin mutations to Server Actions; keep complex/long-running via API routes
  - [x] 3.1 Identify simple mutations per panel (e.g., Bundles: create, update visibility; Podcasts: create/update/toggle active)
    - Bundles (candidates for Server Actions): create bundle; update `min_plan`; replace podcasts membership; delete bundle (guard checks stay server-side)
    - Podcasts (candidates for Server Actions): create; update fields; toggle `is_active`; delete (with usage guard)
    - Episodes: keep API for generation and upload (long-running, file I/O, safe GCS init)
  - [x] 3.2 Implement Server Actions in server panels for identified simple mutations ("use server"), reusing Prisma and existing validation (Bundles implemented; Podcasts added)
  - [x] 3.3 Update client panels to call Server Actions (keep `generate-bundle-episode` and `upload-episode` via APIs) â€” Bundles complete; Podcasts create/update/toggle/delete wired
  - [ ] 3.4 Optional: Add optimistic UI for simple mutations where safe

- [x] 4.0 Verify and enforce admin authorization across pages, Server Components, Server Actions, and API routes
  - [x] 4.1 Add admin checks to server panels where missing (`BundlesPanel.server.tsx`, `PodcastsPanel.server.tsx`)
  - [x] 4.2 Protect `app/api/admin/test/route.ts` with `requireAdminMiddleware`
  - [x] 4.3 Smoke test access patterns for admin vs non-admin users

- [x] 5.0 Legacy cleanup: retire `components/admin-components/**` after replacing usages; resolve `collections/[id]` dependency
  - [x] 5.1 Rehome `components/admin-components/source-list*` to a non-admin location (e.g., `components/data-components/`) and update imports in `collections/[id]/page.tsx`
  - [x] 5.2 Remove `components/admin-components/**` once no references remain
  - [x] 5.3 Remove obsolete docs references to CSS modules if any remain relevant

- [ ] 6.0 Tests and quality gates: add/adjust tests, ensure `pnpm build` and `pnpm lint` pass, and validate no regressions
  - [x] 6.1 Add/adjust tests for server-side reads and server actions (at least one per panel)
  - [ ] 6.2 Run full test suite and fix failures
  - [ ] 6.3 Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`; fix issues
  - [ ] 6.4 Prepare a brief migration notes update and verify feature flags behavior in local and CI
