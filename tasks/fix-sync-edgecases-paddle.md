# Task List to process

- [ ] 1.0 Seperate sync logic and functions
  - [x] 1.1 Make sure `syncMembership` reverts to handle ONLY the checkout flow ONLY when "checkout buttons" listen for checkout.open() checkout.close() to sync members
  - [ ] 1.2 Create a new `syncPaddleWithDb` function whuch is used for any edge cases (where a user has a paid subscription but its not synced to our database) using any appropriate paddlejs event. Do a web search to get updated information as your knowlegde might be currently outdated before creating this new function.
  - [ ] 1.3 Run `pnpm lint` and resolve any linting errors.
  - [ ] 1.4 Run all `vitest` tests (`pnpm test`) and ensure they pass. Update existing tests or add new ones as necessary to cover the new sync functions with checkout and user data


## Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implemlementation guide

- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Run the full test suite (`pnpm test`.)
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
      - Lists key changes and additions
  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been coentationmmitted, mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

### Notes

- I created my subscription using the same API keys and successfully verified it in the Paddle dashboard. We need to be able to sync the data regardless of the checkout when we need to, especially for edge cases. Therefore, please use the event from PaddleJS. This should be a common practice: use any event that returns the user’s Paddle subscription data (this sync button is separate from the checkout sync logic).
- Let me be absolutely clear: the API keys are not the issue.
- We also need to separate checkout.  sync = purelyFor checkout, we need to open and close it. Additionally, we need an additional sync that forces the paddlejs data to sync with our database. This is to support any edge cases where a user has a subscription verified by paddle but
