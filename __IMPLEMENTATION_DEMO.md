# Audio Player Zustand Integration - Demo Guide

## Implementation Complete ✅

This document demonstrates the successful implementation of the Zustand global state management for the AudioPlayerSheet component.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Global Audio Player Store
```typescript
// store/audioPlayerStore.ts
export interface AudioPlayerStore {
  episode: Episode | UserEpisode | null;
  isSheetOpen: boolean;
  setEpisode: (episode: Episode | UserEpisode) => void;
  closeSheet: () => void;
}
```

### 2. Episode Card Integration
**Before:** Each page had its own audio player with portal rendering
**After:** All episode cards now use the global store:

```typescript
// Example from dashboard/page.tsx
<Button 
  onClick={() => {
    setEpisode(episode); // Opens AudioPlayerSheet automatically
  }} 
  variant="play" 
/>
```

### 3. AudioPlayerSheet Features
- ✅ Displays episode image, title, and description
- ✅ **Show More/Less transcript functionality**
- ✅ Full audio controls (Play/Pause, Seek, Progress, Volume, Mute)
- ✅ Handles both Episode and UserEpisode types
- ✅ Styled according to Figma design specifications

## Pages Updated

1. **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**
   - Recent user episodes → Use Zustand store
   - Bundle episodes → Use Zustand store

2. **Episodes (`/episodes`)**
   - Episode list → Use Zustand store
   - Removed old portal audio player

3. **My Episodes (`/my-episodes`)**
   - User-generated episodes → Use Zustand store
   - Removed inline audio player

4. **Dashboard Copy (`/dashboard-copy`)**
   - Updated to match main dashboard implementation

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Navigate to any episode page
```
/dashboard
/episodes  
/my-episodes
```

### 2. Click any "Play" button on episode cards
- Should open AudioPlayerSheet on the right
- Should display episode information
- Should start audio playback

### 3. Test transcript functionality
- Look for "Show More/Less" button
- Click to expand/collapse transcript
- Verify smooth animation

### 4. Test audio controls
- Play/Pause button
- Progress bar (click to seek)
- Volume control with mute
- Close button (X)
